This directory contains the support for modifing the Scilab/Scicos code 
generation, so that it can be used within RTAI user space soft/hard real time
and monitered with RTAI-Lab.

To use it you have to download and install the full source Scilab release 
from "www.scilab.org", it contains Scicos already and the
CodeGeneration macro. 

Then:
- fully install Scilab;
- duplicate CodeGeneration_.sci under macros/scicos with another name,
  if you want to keep the original with   the one to be used for RTAI only; 
- edit "CodeGenration_.sci", in the "macros" directory found here, to
  modify in the function "gen_make_unix" the lines: 
       "RTAIDIR = <RTAI home dir>"
       "RTSCIDIR = /usr/local/scicos"
       "SCIDIR = /usr/lib/scilab-2.7"
  to fit your installation.
- edit the DEST macro, in "macros/copyto" found here, to point to the Scilab 
  code generation directory that will be used to support RTAI;
- do ./copyto from the "macros" directory
- move in the directory macros/scicos under scilab and run "make" to
  build the new CodeGeneration_.bin

At this point you are ready to generate code for RTAI, in the very same way 
used for the original Scilab/Scicos CodeGen. Scicos generated code is 
structured with names in the form "model_...", "model" being the identifier
of your model. 
With RTAI you must make and use what generated as "model_standalone". As said 
the overall RTAI specific procedure is not different than the standard Scicos 
CodeGen way. So refer to Scicos and CodeGen docs for more informations, a basic
understanding of such a documentation is taken for granted in the followings.

It must be noticed however that the code generator knows nothing about the IOs 
that will be used in the actual controller execution. So it generates just a 
related void template function that must be completed according to what has to 
be done in each specific case. 
Such a function, "model_void_io.c", will remain unchanged till any input/output
is added/deleted in the model. Thus "model_standalone.c" does not use it but 
expects to find a function, "model_io.c", that carries out the real working 
code. 
Then, at the very first code generation, or whenever any input/output is 
changed, the user must care of updating "model_io.c" to mate the structure of
the most uptodate template "model_void_io.c" for the application at
hand or using the procedure explained under "Create the IO". 
If nothing, but a mere coping of "model_void_io.c" into model_io.c, is done the 
code will run without any "visible" effect. So there is no doubt that you'll 
have to do something if the code has to be used with some external hardware, 
but even simple tests require something be done to produce anything "visible".
The Scicos sensors/actuators template is very simple and completing it for a
specific application at hand should be quite easy. The most usual case implies
just writing and reading data to/from one or more DAQ cards. By using 
kcomedi_lxrt support that will imply just setting up appropriate calls to 
kcomedy at the points suggested by the template Scicos IO functions. 
The sensors/actuators function can be readily useful also to implement what is 
needed for distributed applications. 

Model_io.c must contain also the void body of the function:
	void model_upar_update(int index); 
a callback function used when additional parameters, specifically assigned by 
the user, are changed. Such parameters are contained in a double vector, that 
must be named UPAR1 with size NUPAR1, to be allocated by the user in the 
init call of sensors/actuators. UPAR1 is an already available pointer to such 
a vector that must be initialised in "model_io.c" to point to the corresponding 
array set up by the user in "model_io.c" and the global variable NUPAR1 must 
be assigned the related value accordingly. Such parameters can then be changed 
by using "(x)rtailab" and at each parameter change "model_upar_update" is 
called with the related index of the UPAR1 component to be modified. The use 
of such a callback is multifaceted and depends on the application. Notable 
examples are dynamic configuration of DAQs ports, user specific implementations 
of signal generations and distributed control systems management using net_rpc. 
Clearly nothing has to be done if the user has no need for his/her own 
parameters.

The RTAI specific Scicos code generation allows you to execute the generated
code in soft/hard real time, monitor its execution and change parameters on 
the fly, both locally and remotely. It shows the power and ease afforded by 
RTAI in setting up a local/distributed processing, by using the "net_rpc"
based "(x)rtailab".

Many controllers can then be installed, either on a single local computer or 
distributed on local/remote nodes. They all are supervised/monitored with 
RTAI-Lab, thus allowing to manage multiple instance of both Scicos and RTW 
applications. See the related README in RTAI-Lab specific directory.

As mentioned Scicos based applications can be implemented also in a distributed
way. No specific scheme is made available. It is preferred to let each user do 
what he/she wants. As said anything should be easily carried out in the 
sensors/actuators part of the code by using net_rpc support. In violation
to the previous statement a general provision has been embedded for providing
externally generated local/remote timing events. It will be explained further 
on and can be used by way of example for other types of remote coordinations.

It must be noticed that the change of a Scicos model parameters cannot be done
in a too friendly way as no (human) parameter id is generated, at the moment, 
by CodeGen. So you must know some Scicos internals to guess the position each 
parameter occupies in the vectors RPAR1/IPAR1, found in your model, and be 
sure it can be changed at each sampling time. 
As a help to an easier understanding of where your parameters are placed 
within RPAR1 it should be noticed that RTAI-Lab allows to look at and change 
the parameters before beginning any actual execution. So by setting up fancy 
numbers in the Scicos model, at its code generation, you can see them before 
activating your controller, know where they are, set back their correct 
values before execution and then change them during the controller execution 
also. It is a bit silly operation but can help in guiding you to do what you 
want, almost without knowing Scicos internals. A typical scheme used at DIAPM 
for real parameters is to use practically nonsignificant digits as memos of the
related variable. In such a way you know the parameters "who is who" without
having to change them before beginning the controller execution. 
Integer parameters might be more difficult in this respect but they are often 
untouchable or require to be changed more rarely.

A rough understanding of the Scilab/Scicos internals is nonetheless clearly 
a good asset. The essential fact to be recalled is that any dynamic block will 
end into RPAR1 as a standard discrete quadruple [A, B; C, D] other single 
parameter blocks, e.g. constants and gains remaining standalone. A look at 
model.cosf might be of help also.

The same problem exists for the model input/output template function and it is
up to you to take care of the way Scicos numbers your input/output, so that 
you can code appropriately the sensor/actuator code in "model_io.c". Again no 
parameter id is provided by user parameters and they must be recognised just 
through their indices. Clearly in this case it is easier anyhow as the user 
is doing it all directly.

A clearer understanding of what is possible to do can be achieved by reading
the explaination of the available execution parameters in the main README.

As it has been said above the Scicos controller driver generator has a native
way to implement the "drevent" option. To use such a feature a controller must 
use the function:
void WaitTimerEvent(unsigned long TimerEventArg). 
In fact WaitTimerEvent is a pointer to such a function and TimerEventArg a 
global variable. As hinted immediatly above they must be set up during 
controller iniatialisation. The local/remote server must provide the conjugate 
function to wake up the controller according to its timing, or any other 
protocol agreed. The function:
void SendTimerEvent(unsigned long TimerEventArg), 
must also be provided by setting the related pointer within the controller. 
Such a function is the very same function used by the local/remote server, 
albeit in local mode. It is required to awake the controller to have it 
smoothly ended asynchonously by the supervisor program.
The default periodic execution comes through the pair: 
rt_task_make_periodic - rt_task_wait_period. 
It allows to have the controller ended by the supervisor without any specific 
event, its termination coming at the next period anyhow.

An helper application is provided to illustrate what explained above. It
consists in a summed PID controller, with integrator controlled saturation as
antiwindup, mated to a simple second order discrete dynamic system to have a
realistic impression of what happens at parameters modifications. It features
a single output, the signal to be tracked by the controllers, and two output,
the input and tracked signals. Two more output are added that have nothing to
do with the controller. They are there to show:
- an example of how a switch can be operated by changing the value of its
  constant input (RPAR1 # 25);
- the change of an integer parameter to switch from a uniform to a Gausssion 
  random signal (IPAR1 # 37);
- piling up a few more signal to have more scopes activity, a total of 4 
  signals are available for the scopes and there are "pid_io.c.2ch" and 
  "pid_io.c.4ch" to watch them using either two two traces scopes or a single 
  four traces one.

The all system can be viewed in Scicos by loading pid.cosf. All the blocks
visualised by Scicos can have their parameters modified during execution and 
a look at the PID layout with Scicos is suggested to understand what parameters
are in the game and have a reminder at their position in RPAR1 by looking at
their values. 
The signal tracked by the PID is generated in the sensors function "pid_io.c" 
and its outputs are sent to RTAI-Lab through mailboxes, initialised and used 
in the actuators part of "pid_io.c". 
"pid_io.c" contains also the initialisation of five user parameters. The first 
three are the amplitude, circular frequency and phase of a the generated sine 
signal. The fourth is used for remote operation and the fifth is a spare.

The function "pid_upar_update" is coded in "pid_io.c" to provide an example of
a remote application by using a local task suspend and a remote task resume.
A remote instance of the PID controller can synchronize its execution with
that of a remote peer by executing a remote task resume at each sampling of
its sensor input. It gets the node of the remote peer each time the fourth 
user parameter is set to the dotted decimal notation (ddn) of its peer 
computer. It stops executing the remote peer each time such a parameter is 
reset to zero. The support for coding the dotted decimal notation is available 
internally by setting the ddn into a double, in blocks of three decimal digits.
So 127.0.0.1 must be given as 127000000001, 131.175.154.195 as 131175154195 
and so on.
More complex specific distributed policies implementations should come easy
by appropriate usage of sensors/actuators/upar_update functions. Clearly
if some form of true distributed real time is required the use of RTNet is
compulsory.
Notice also that distributed implementations can be embedded in Scicos models, 
RTAI providing distributed activations signals to Scicos blocks through
"model_io.c".

Create the IO
=============
by Roberto Bucher roberto.bucher@supsi.ch

The command "make install" from the folder "rtailab/scilab" allows to
install all the necessary files on the right place. Edit "Makefile" to
change the default folders.

After this installation you get a library named "ulibsci.a" under
"/usr/local/scicos". This library contains all the procedures needed
to integrate different I/O in the scicos model.

Each I/O is characterized by:

- a name (ex. step)
- inp or out (inp means a sensor, out means an actuator)
- a port (it means the port in the scicos model)
- an information about channel or identification
- a string which describes the modul
- 5 parameters that can complete the setting of the I/O

You have to provid all this parameters in the configuration file.

Example of configuration file:
------------------------------
square inp 1 0 0 1.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 0.0
rtai_scope out 1 2 IO 0 0 0 0 0
end

square inp 1 0 0 1.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 0.0
   |    |  | | |  |   |    |   |   |_delay
   |    |  | | |  |   |    |   |_bias
   |    |  | | |  |   |    |_semiperiod
   |    |  | | |  |   |_period
   |    |  | | |  |_Amplitude
   |    |  | | |_name (unused)
   |    |  | |_id/ch (unused)
   |    |  |_port on scicos model
   |    |_sensor
   |_type is square generator

rtai_scope out 1 2 IO 0 0 0 0 0
    |       |  | |  | | | | | |_unused
    |       |  | |  | | | | |_unused
    |       |  | |  | | | |_unused
    |       |  | |  | | |_unused
    |       |  | |  | |_unused
    |       |  | |  |_scope name
    |       |  | |_number of scope signals
    |       |  |_port on scicos model
    |       |_actuator
    |_type is rtai_scope
    
A description of the available IO is given in "io.pdf"

The command "gen_io <model> <configfile>" generates automatically the
file "model_io.c".

Code generation under Scilab
============================

1.  open "scilab"
2.  run "scicos()"
3.  load "test.cos"
4.  generate the code from the superblock
5.  exit scilab
6.  enter the directory "test"
7.  give the command "gen_io test config" to create the file test_io.c
8.  compile the files to create "test_standalone" using
    "make -f test_Makefile test_standalone" 
9.  load the rtai modules (rtai, rtai_shm, rtai_sched,
    rtai_lxrt, rtai_fifos, net_rpc)
10. run urtnet &
11. start "./test_standalone"
12. open xrtailab and connect (local or remote) to the application
13. open the scopes
14. stop test_standalone (Ctrl-C)
15. unload the modules when you finish
 
Adding your own I/O
===================

The utility "gen_dev" allows to simply create a skeleton for your own
I/O. Simply run the command "gen_dev <name> to get a new file <name>.c
which can be edited to fit your I/O. The command "gen_dev" modify the
include file "devices.h" too, adding all the new generated procedure;
modify this file by hand if necessary.

Minimal functions for sensors are:
inp_<name>_init(...)
inp_<name>_input(...)
inp_<name>_update(...)
inp_<name>_end(...) 

Minimal functions for actuators are:
out_<name>_init(...)
out_<name>_output(...)
out_<name>_end(...) 

Now simply add your file <name>.c to the Makefile under "SRC" and run 
"make" to generate the new library ulibsci.a. Copy this library under
"/usr/local/scicos/" and then you are ready to use your own I/O.
